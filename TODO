CGR:
1. use camera with OpenCV - done
2. make buttons bigger - done
3. connect gallery drag to scrool(for touchscreen)
   note: no drag signal, try to use follow:
         1. onPressed - get cursor coords(start);
         2. scrolldown on |Y at start -  coord on changed|;
         3. maybe create slot and signal for 1 to 2;
4. find bug in {gallery to result by onTableItemClick}
...
?. wait for Qt 5.2
